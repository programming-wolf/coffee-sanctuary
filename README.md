# Coffee Sanctuary

Welcome to my personal coffee sanctuary. This is a list of all the coffee shops that I went to, so that I can check if there's a nice coffee shop in town when travelling. 
It's similar to all those "Awesome something" lists, but it's based on my personal experience with coffee shops. 

If you have any proposals of coffee shops that I should visit, please [create an issue for it](https://github.com/programming-wolf/coffee-sanctuary/issues/new). Should you find any mistakes regarding websites, addresses, or anything related to one of the coffee shops listed here, feel free to create a pull request. :-)

## Berlin
### The Barn
I actually never visited one of the cafés. However, I do have a coffee subscription for pour-over coffee with them, and most of the coffees were great. 
They do have several (9, I believe) shops in Berlin. 
* Coffee: self-roasted. Great coffee beans for both pour over and espresso-based drinks. 
* Website: [https://thebarn.de](https://thebarn.de)

### Father Carpenter
* Address: Münzstraße 21, 10178 Berlin ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/jDM9FEXEsEazmqqf8), [Apple Maps](https://maps.apple.com/?address=M%C3%BCnzstra%C3%9Fe%2021,%20Mitte,%2010178%20Berlin,%20Germany&ll=52.524799,13.406807&q=M%C3%BCnzstra%C3%9Fe%2021))
* Coffee: self-roasted. I only tried espresso-based drinks. Espresso was a bit too sour for my taste, but Cappuccino and Flat White tasted amazing.
* Food: super tasty. Recommendations are the vegan banana bread and the "Avocado", sour-dough toast with several toppings.

## Dresden
### Moka Café
* Address: Schützengasse 2, 01067 Dresden ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/e2D4xYavoAg4JmBU8), [Apple Maps](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Sch%C3%BCtzengasse%202,%2001067%20Dresden,%20Germany&ll=51.054467,13.727288&q=Sch%C3%BCtzengasse%202))
* Coffee: _not_ self-roasted. When I was there, they had coffee from The Barn (see above) and [Manhattan Coffee Roasters](https://manhattancoffeeroasters.com). Nevertheless, it was prepared well and tasted great. 
* Food: Amazing self made granola and cookies.

* Coffee: self-roasted. Very good flat white, even the decaf was tasty (which was a first). 
* Food: All the food, both sweet and regular things, are incredible. I strongly recommend the cheese cake with raspberries.
