# Coffee Sanctuary

Welcome to my personal coffee sanctuary. This is a list of all the coffee shops that I went to, so that I can check if there's a nice coffee shop in town when travelling. 
It's similar to all those "Awesome something" lists, but it's based on my personal experience with coffee shops. 

If you have any proposals of coffee shops that I should visit, please [create an issue for it](https://github.com/programming-wolf/coffee-sanctuary/issues/new). Should you find any mistakes regarding websites, addresses, or anything related to one of the coffee shops listed here, feel free to create a pull request. :-)
